    <p>
      Hello! My name is Sam Bakenhus, or you may also know me by my online
      handle SquidJelly. I'm a 2D Game Developer that's been working part-time
      since 2008, and full-time now since 2016.

      I hold experience in nearly every aspect of game development working in
      many different genres and deploying for desktop, web & mobile. I'm
      comfortable in a wealth of different programming languages and libraries;
      Working with graphics, physics, logic, networking and AI. I pride myself
      on being a multi-disciplinary game developer, bringing whatever is needed
      to the project.

      Games are still a relatively new form of media. I believe we'll continue
      to see them grow and dominate as an art form in the years to come and I'm
      very much looking forward to being a part of it.
